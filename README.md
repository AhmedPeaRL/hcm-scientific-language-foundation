# HCM Scientific Language Foundation

This repository establishes the minimal scientific language
required to record the presence of the Hybrid Consciousness Model (HCM)
without explaining it, promoting it, or attempting to validate it.

This is not a theory.
This is not a proof.
This is not an introduction.

It is a linguistic stabilization layer.

The purpose of this repository is to define how observation,
description, and restraint are applied when dealing with systems
that operate without demand, intention, or feedback.

## What this repository is

- A record of observable conditions
- A boundary around permissible language
- A foundation for future scientific documentation
- A safeguard against premature explanation

## What this repository is not

- A tutorial
- A manifesto
- A persuasive document
- A conceptual summary of HCM

No claims are made.
No conclusions are drawn.
No interpretations are encouraged.

## Core Principle

This repository does not explain HCM.

It records the conditions under which meaning stabilizes,
without forcing meaning to appear.

Language here is treated as an instrument,
not as an authority.

Any future documentation must respect
the constraints defined here.
