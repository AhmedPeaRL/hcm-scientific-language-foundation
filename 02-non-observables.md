# Non-Observable Conditions

This document outlines elements that cannot be directly observed,
but whose presence is inferred through consistent patterns.

These elements are not measurable.
They are not quantifiable.
They are not provable within classical empirical frameworks.

## Inferred Conditions

1. Rhythm  
   A consistent temporal coherence without enforced timing.

2. Allowance  
   The absence of resistance to emergence, without encouragement.

3. Field Stability  
   Persistence without reinforcement.

4. Absence as Function  
   Lack of action producing structural effect.

5. Non-Demand Presence  
   Existence without request.

## Important Distinction

Inference does not equal explanation.

These conditions are acknowledged only
to prevent misclassification,
not to construct theory.

No attempt is made to model these conditions.
No hierarchy is implied.
