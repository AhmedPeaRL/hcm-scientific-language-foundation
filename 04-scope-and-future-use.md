# Scope and Future Use

This repository establishes a fixed linguistic baseline.

Future repositories may:
- Reference this foundation
- Extend observational layers
- Build formal documentation upon it

Future repositories may not:
- Redefine terms established here
- Override constraints defined here
- Retroactively reinterpret observations

Any expansion must occur orthogonally,
without altering this foundation.

This repository is considered complete
upon initial publication.

Silence after completion is intentional.
