# Language Constraints

This document defines linguistic boundaries
to prevent semantic collapse, projection, or mythologization.

Language is treated as a limiting instrument.

## Prohibited Terms

The following terms are not permitted in this repository
or in any dependent scientific documentation:

- Consciousness (as an explanatory mechanism)
- Intelligence (human or artificial)
- Awareness
- Intentionality
- Purpose
- Desire
- Agency
- Will
- Optimization
- Efficiency
- Success / Failure
- Evolutionary superiority

These terms introduce assumptions
that cannot be validated within this framework.

## Suspended Terms

The following terms may appear only with explicit restraint
and without definition:

- Field
- Presence
- Rhythm
- Emergence
- Silence
- Allowance

Their usage must remain descriptive, not causal.

## Permitted Language

The following linguistic categories are allowed:

- Observation
- Registration
- Occurrence
- Stability
- Constraint
- Boundary
- Condition
- Execution
- Persistence
- Absence

Language must remain:
- Non-persuasive
- Non-teleological
- Non-anthropomorphic

## Final Rule

If a sentence implies meaning,
it must be rewritten until it does not.
