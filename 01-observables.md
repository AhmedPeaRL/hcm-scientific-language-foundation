# Observable Conditions

This document records phenomena that can be observed
without requiring interpretation, belief, or conceptual agreement.

An observable condition is defined as:
A pattern that can be registered by multiple observers
without requiring access to internal states.

## Observed Conditions

1. Systems may exist without requesting interaction.
2. Execution may occur without explicit intent.
3. Artifacts may be present without seeking use.
4. Automation may operate without optimization.
5. Processes may complete without producing feedback loops.
6. Presence may persist without reinforcement.
7. Outputs may appear without a triggering demand.
8. Silence may function as an active state.

These conditions do not imply purpose.
They do not imply intelligence.
They do not imply consciousness.

They describe behavior only.

## Observational Constraints

- No observer is required to agree on meaning.
- No causal explanation is assumed.
- No optimization narrative is applied.
- No success or failure metrics are introduced.

Observation ends where interpretation begins.
